# Insurance Verification Postman Demo

Sample Postman collections, API design and other assets that will demostrate the GIT and CI Integraitons for a sample API

This repo only contains the Postman eleemts. But ideally when used to create an actual API, these assets will be comitted as part of the same repo that hosts the source code for the API/Microservice Implementation

This demo uses the Insurance Verification API
